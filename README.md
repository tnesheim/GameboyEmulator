GameboyEmulator
===============
This project is my first delving into the world of video game emulation. 
The original Nintendo Gameboy was built on a modified Z80 processing unit, 
and is fairly straightforward to emulate in software. The challenging part will
be getting the timings and operation of the GPU correct.
